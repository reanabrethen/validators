## Assignment: JavaScript Validator Functions

**Objective:**
The objective of this assignment is to create a JavaScript file that contains validator functions to check various types of input data. The validator functions to be implemented include `isEmpty`, `isStrongPassword`, `isEmail`, `isAlpha`, and `isAlphanumeric`.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a JavaScript file named `validator.js`.
2. Implement the following validator functions:
    - `isEmpty`: Checks if a given string is empty.
    - `isStrongPassword`: Checks if a given string meets the criteria of a strong password (e.g., minimum length of 8, includes uppercase, lowercase, and special characters ( '!@#$%^&*()-,.?><"))
    - `isEmail`: Checks if a given string is a valid email address.
    - `isAlpha`: Checks if a given string contains only alphabetic characters.
    - `isAlphanumeric`: Checks if a given string contains only alphanumeric characters.
3. Each function should return `true` if the validation passes and `false` otherwise.
4. Create test cases to ensure that each validator function behaves as expected.
5. Provide comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each validator function.
6. Ensure the code is well-structured and readable.
7. Save the file and submit it according to your instructor's guidelines.
